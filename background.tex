\section{Background}

			In cloud computing, there are multiple recognized service models which dictate how the users can use the given system and what privileges they are given \cite{Mell:2011:SND:2206223}. In its most limited form, a cloud service is offered to user as a predefined application or a set of applications. The users has some interface for interacting with the applications but is given no control over anything else such as other applications, the operating system the application is running on or network and hardware configurations. This is generally known as Software as a Service or SaaS for short. The most permissible service model is known as IaaS, Infrastructure as a Service. In its archetype the user gets access to all fundamental computing resources, possibly including some network components, and can run arbitrary software including operating systems. The user experience should be similar to that with their personal computers. The user is not allowed to access the underlying cloud infrastructure. Between the two falls Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS typically allows user to deploy their own applications along with their dependent libraries, tools, services etc. provided that they are supported by the cloud provider. The user has no control over underlying cloud infrastructure, operating system, storage or network but usually can configure certain settings and possibly choose different supporting services the cloud provider offers. There are also other "aaS" such as Data as a Service (DaaS) and Storage as a Service (SaaS) but they are based on one of the three aforementioned service models or are variations or subsets of them. Sometimes the numerous models are referenced with umbrella terms of XaaS and EaaS meaning Everything as a Service for both or Anything as a Service for the former \cite{XaaS}.

Virtualisation in the context of distributed cloud environments usually refers to virtual machines. The core idea is analogous to computer hardware virtualisation. Operating systems offer an interface for the processes to utilize the computer hardware while giving them an illusion that they have all of the hardware for themselves \cite{ArpaciDusseau14-Book}. In reality the resources are shared among many processes. Likewise in cloud environments resources are being share by processes but also by different users running different operating systems, configurations and programs. As with the processes, users are given an impression that they alone have access to the underlying hardware resources, whereas in reality there are multiple users using the same physical machines.


There are several reasons as to why would one prefer a virtualised environment to a non-virtualised one. Obviously in multitenant cloud services it is crucial for the service provider to maximise the use of their hardware resources. Thus it is imperative for the provider to try to share the limited hardware resources among as many users' virtualised environments as possible. Otherwise every user would need their own physical machine in the system which would both require more resources per user and leave resources underused. From the fault tolerance perspective, using virtual machines in a distributed environment decreases their dependency on the underlying physical hardware \cite{Clark05livemigration}. That is because in virtual machine architectures which support live migration of operating system instances can be seamlessly moved from one physical machine to another. This also helps the load-balancing in the distributed system and allows low-level and physical maintenance of the hardware without considerably disrupting the usage of the system. A end-user also has many reasons to use virtualised cloud services. User only needs a lightweight computer with an internet connection to perform computationally challenging tasks in the cloud back-end. Similarly devices with little storage capacity can leverage from a cloud service's vast storage space. Some users would like to use applications and programs not native to their operating system of choice.
