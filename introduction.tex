\section{Introduction}

The usage of computational devices and services has seen radical new trends in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. The number of different devices keeps growing and the prevalence of smartphones is nothing short of ubiquitous \cite{anderson2015technology}. With the emergence of Internet of Things devices, the amount of different computers at our disposal is a stark contrast to recent past when there was only one PC per household. In addition to quantity of devices, the way they are used has also changed. Devices are mobile and have sensing capabilities. Applications and storage space are no longer tied to personal hardware but served from cloud services.

In cloud computing, virtualisation is essential for delivering services to a large userbase. Virtualisation enables the cloud provider to share their limited hardware resources optimally among users, balance workloads and improve fault tolerance.
