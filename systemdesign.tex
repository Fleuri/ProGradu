\section{System Design and Implementation}

Current cloud management platforms make simplified assumptions about the hardware in the datacentre and its usage. Hardware is by default powerful rack or blade servers, they are virtualised and always on. Thus cloud management platforms on the market are suboptimal for certain use cases.

High Powered Computing (HPC) and Big Data applications require highly optimised and powerful hardware. In such applications, the overheads imposed by virtualisation are undesirable and for maximum efficiency the cluster should consist of the so-called bare-metal computing nodes. Furthermore other advantages of virtualisation such as multitenancy and scaling are not useful in bare-metal computing.
