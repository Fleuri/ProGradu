\section{System Design and Implementation}

Current cloud management platforms make simplified assumptions about the hardware in the datacentre and its usage. Hardware is by default powerful rack or blade servers, they are virtualised and always on. Thus cloud management platforms on the market are suboptimal for certain use cases.

High Powered Computing (HPC) and Big Data applications require highly optimised and powerful hardware. In such applications, the overheads imposed by virtualisation are undesirable and for maximum efficiency the cluster should consist of the so-called bare-metal computing nodes. Furthermore other advantages of virtualisation such as multi-tenancy and scaling are not useful in bare-metal computing.

On the other end of the spectrum are very weak computers with limited computing power, memory, I/O throughput and storage. These machines can be a worthwhile addition to a cloud environment for running small low intensity tasks: They are significantly cheaper to traditional datacentre hardware costing some hundred euros per machine instead of thousands as with a single rack server, they do not require much space to store, use less electricity and output less heat. Virtualisation may not be applicable for such machines either due to hardware not supporting virtualisation in the first place, or as the virtualisation overhead may consume large enough share of a machine's resources rendering it incapable to perform or at least severely restricting any other functionality besides virtualisation. With low end computers virtualisation benefits like multi-tenancy and running multiple operating systems in parallel may simply not be possible because of limited capabilities. Using these machines in a heterogeneous cluster requires treating them like a traditional bare-metal nodes, albeit not nearly as powerful.
